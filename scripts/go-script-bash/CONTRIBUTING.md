# Welcome!

I'm so glad you've found this project interesting and useful enough that you'd
like to contribute to its development.

Please take time to review the policies and procedures in this document prior
to making and submitting any changes.

This guide was drafted with tips from [Wrangling Web Contributions: How to Build
a CONTRIBUTING.md][moz] and with some inspiration from [the Atom project's
CONTRIBUTING.md file][atom].

## Code of conduct

Harrassment or rudeness of any kind will not be tolerated, period. For
specifics, see the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file.

## Reporting issues

Before reporting an issue, please use the search feature on the [issues
page][issues] to see if an issue matching the one you've observed has already
been filed.

If you do find one...

[issues]: https://github.com/mbland/go-script-bash/issues

### Do not add a +1 comment!

If you find an issue that interests you, but you have nothing material to
contribute to the thread, use the *Subscribe* button on the right side of the
page to receive notifications of further conversations or a resolution. Comments
consisting only of "+1" or the like tend to clutter the thread and make it more
painful to follow the discussion.

If you _do_ have something to add to the conversation, or _don't_ find a
matching issue...

### Update an existing issue or file a new one

Try to be as specific as possible about your environment and the problem you're
observing. At a minimum, include:

- The output from `./go goinfo`
- Command line steps or code snippets that reproduce the issue
- Any apparently relevant information from the [Bash changelog][bash-changes]

[bash-changes]: https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/CHANGES

Also consider using:

- bash's `time` builtin to collect running times
- a regression test to add to the suite
- memory usage as reported by a tool such as
  [memusg](https://gist.github.com/netj/526585)

## Updating documentation

If you've a passion for writing clear, accessible documentation, please don't be
shy about sending pull requests! The documentation is just as important as the
code, especially in this project, since the goal is to make the functionality as
discoverable as possible through the `./go help` command.

Also: _no typo is too small to fix!_ Really. Of course, batches of fixes are
preferred, but even one nit is one nit too many.

## Environment setup

Make sure you have Bash installed per the [Environment setup in the
README][env-setup].

[env-setup]: README.md#environment-setup

You will also need [Git][] installed on your system. If you are not familiar
with Git, you may wish to reference the [Git documentation][git-doc].

[git-doc]: https://git-scm.com/doc

## Workflow

The basic workflow for submitting changes resembles that of the [GitHub Git
Flow][git-flow], except that you will be working with your own fork of the
repository and issuing pull requests to the original.

[git-flow]: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

1. Fork the repo on GitHub (look for the "Fork" button)
2. Clone your forked repo to your local machine
3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
4. Develop _and [test](#testing)_ your changes as necessary.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
6. Create a new [GitHub pull request][gh-pr] for your feature branch based
   against the original repository's `master` branch
7. If your request is accepted, you can [delete your feature branch][rm-branch]
   and pull the updated `master` branch from the original repository into your
   fork. You may even [delete your fork][rm-fork] if you don't anticipate making
   further changes.

[gh-pr]:     https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/
[rm-branch]: https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-unused-branches/
[rm-fork]:   https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-a-repository/

## Testing

- Continuous integration status for Linux and macOS: [![Continuous integration status for Linux and macOS](https://img.shields.io/travis/mbland/go-script-bash/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mbland/go-script-bash)
- Continuous integration status for Windows: [![Continuous integration status for Windows](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/mbland/go-script-bash/master.svg)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mbland/go-script-bash)
- Coverage status: [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mbland/go-script-bash/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/mbland/go-script-bash?branch=master)

No bug fixes or new features will be accepted without accompanying tests.
Period.

Any changes that break the continuous integration build must be fixed or rolled
back immediately.

This project uses the [Bash Automated Testing System (Bats)][bats] to write and
run tests. All tests and helper scripts are in the `tests/` directory and are
run using the `./go test` command. This command has a very flexible syntax for
running a subset of test suites (i.e. a set of test cases within individual
`.bats` files or directories). Enabling tab completion via `./go env` is highly
encouraged.

[bats]: https://github.com/sstephenson/bats

Before sending your code for review, make sure to run the entire test suite via
`./go test`. If you're on a Linux system that uses the `apt-get` package manager
(e.g. Ubuntu, Debian), run `./go test --coverage` to make sure your changes are
adequately covered by new and existing tests. This will install (within the
project working directory) and run the [kcov][] tool, which is only available on
Linux for now.

- [Command substitution](#command-substitution)
- [Conditions and loops](#conditionals-and-loops)
- [Output](#output)
- [Gotchas](#gotchas)

### Formatting

- Keep all files 80 characters wide. (Yes, the maintainer is a dinosaur who
  likes viewing files side-by-side in a 161-column terminal window.)
- Indent using two spaces.
- Enclose all variables in double quotes when used to avoid having them
  interpreted as glob patterns (unless the variable contains a glob pattern)
  and to avoid word splitting when the value contains spaces. Both scenarios
  can introduce errors that often prove difficult to diagnose.
  - **This is especially important when the variable is used to generate a
    glob pattern**, since spaces may appear in a path value.
  - If the variable itself contains a glob pattern, make sure to set
    `IFS=$'\n'` before using it so that the pattern itself and any matching
    file names containing spaces are not split apart.
  - Exceptions: Quotes are not required within math contexts, i.e. `(( ))` or
    `$(( ))`, and must not be used for variables on the right side of the `=~`
    operator.
- Enclose all string literals in single quotes.
  - Exception: If the string contains an apostrophe, use double quotes.
- Use quotes around variables and literals even inside of `[[ ]]` conditions.
  - This is because strings that contain '[' or ']' characters may fail to
    compare equally when they should.
  - Exception: Do not quote variables that contain regular expression patterns
    appearing on the right side of the `=~` operator.
- _Only_ quote arguments to the right of `=~` if the expression is a literal
  match without any metacharacters.

The following are intended to prevent too-compact code:

- Declare only one item per `declare`, `local`, `export`, or `readonly` call.
  - _Note:_ This also helps avoid subtle bugs, as trying to initialize one
    variable using the value of another declared in the same statement will
    not do what you may expect. The initialization of the first variable will
    not yet be complete when the second variable is declared, so the first
    variable will have an empty value.
- Do not use one-line `if`, `for`, `while`, `until`, `case`, or `select`
  statements.
- Do not use `&&` or `||` to avoid writing `if` statements.
- Do not write functions entirely on one line.
- For `case` statements: put each pattern on a line by itself; put each command
  on a line by itself; put the `;;` terminator on a line by itself.

_Confession:_ I have used one-liners like crazy in the past. Looking back at my
own code, I've found them difficult to understand. Spreading out declarations,
statements, and functions makes the code easier to follow, as the behavior is
more explicit. It also makes it more `grep`-pable, as "one thing per line" makes
it easier to find, count, and possibly transform things.

### Naming

- Use `snake_case` for all identifiers.
- Constants and globals should be in `ALL_CAPS`, prefixed with `_GO_`.
  - Exception: a global variable used for initialization that isn't used
    anywhere else or intended for export should be all-lowercase, prefixed with
    `__go_`, and `unset` after use, as seen at the top of `libexec/builtins`:
    ```bash
    declare __go_builtin_cmds=()
    function __go_glob_builtin_scripts {
      local c
      for c in "$_GO_CORE_DIR/libexec/"*; do
        if [[ -f "$c" && -x "$c" ]]; then
          __go_builtin_cmds+=("${c##*/}")
        fi
      done
    }
    __go_glob_builtin_scripts
    unset __go_glob_builtin_scripts

    declare -r _GO_BUILTIN_CMDS=("${__go_builtin_cmds[@]}")
    unset __go_builtin_cmds
    ```
- Prefix API functions with `@go.`.
- Prefix internal functions with `_@go.`.
- Prefix variables used to return values to the caller with `__go_`.

### Files

- If the file is a pure library with no executable behavior of its own, put it
  in `lib/`.
- If the file is executable, put it in `libexec/`.
- All logic that is not a constant or global declaration or initializer should
  be contained within a function declaration.
- `libexec/` files should execute a function that represents its main logic and
  which uses `return 1` (or some other value) to indicate an error, e.g. from
  `libexec/help`:
  ```bash
  _@go.help() {
    if [[ "$#" -eq '0' ]]; then
      _@go.usage
    else
      _@go.help_message_for_command "$@"
    fi
  }

  _@go.help "$@"
  ```
  - This makes it easier for other scripts to source the executable script and
    take action on error.

### Function declarations

- Declare functions without the `function` keyword.
- Strive to always use `return`, never `exit`, unless an error condition is
  severe enough to warrant it.
  - Calling `exit` makes it difficult for the caller to recover from an error,
    or to compose new commands from existing ones.

### Variable and parameter declarations

- Declare all constants near the top of the file using `declare -r`.
  - Exception: `declare` is not available in test files run using `bats`.
  - Exception: In module code (i.e. code imported via `. "$_GO_USE_MODULES"`),
    use `readonly` instead. Otherwise if a module is imported into a function,
    variables declared with `declare` will go out of scope after the first
    function call, and will not be redefined for subsequent calls, causing
    errors.
- Avoid globals; but if you must, declare all globals near the top of the file,
  outside of any function, using `declare`.
  - Exception: `declare` is not available in test files run using `bats`.
  - Exception: In module code (i.e. code imported via `. "$_GO_USE_MODULES"`),
    use `export` instead. See the note above regarding `declare -r` and
    `readonly` for details.
  - _Gotcha:_ Never initialize an array on the same line as an `export` or
    `declare -g` statement. See [the Gotchas section](#gotchas) below for more
    details.
- Declare all variables inside functions using `local`.
  - Exception: If an internal function needs to return more than one distinct
    result value, or an array of values, it should use _undeclared_ variables
    prefixed with `__go_`, and all callers should declare these variables as
    local variables.
  - Exception: If a function needs to set a one-time initialization flag, it
    may declare that value using `readonly`.
- Declare temporary file-level variables using `declare`. Use `unset` to remove
  them when finished.
- Don't use `local -r`, as a readonly local variable in one scope can cause a
  conflict when it calls a function that declares a `local` variable of the same
  name.
- Don't use type flags with `declare` or `local`. Assignments to integer
  variables in particular may behave differently, and it has no effect on array
  variables.
- For most functions, the first lines should use `local` declarations to
  assign the original positional parameters to more meaningful names, e.g.:
  ```bash
  _@go.format_summary() {
    local cmd_name="$1"
    local summary="$2"
    local longest_name_len="$3"
  ```
  For very short functions, this _may not_ be necessary, e.g.:
  ```bash
  _@go.has_spaces() {
    [[ "$1" != "${1//[[:space:]]/}" ]]
  }
  ```

### Command substitution

- Use `$()` instead of backticks.

### Process substitution

- Use wherever possible, such as when piping input into a `while` loop (which
  avoids having the loop body execute in a subshell) or running a command taking
  multiple filename arguments based on output from a function or pipeline (e.g.
  `diff`).
- *Warning*: It is impossible to directly determine the exit status of a process
  substitution; emitting an exit status as the last line of output is a possible
  workaround.

### Conditionals and loops

- Always use `[[` and `]]` for evaluating variables. Per the guideline under
  **Formatting**, quote variables and strings within the brackets, but not
  regular expressions (or variables containing regular expressions) appearing
  on the right side of the `=~` operator.

### Output

- Use `@go.printf` for most console output to ensure that the text fits the
  terminal width.
- Use `@go.print_stack_trace` to provide a detailed error message as
  appropriate, usually before calling `exit 1`.

### Gotchas

- If you wish to use command substitution to initialize a `local` variable, and
  then check the exit status of the command substitution, you _must_ declare the
  variable on one line and perform the substitution on another. If you don't,
  the exit status will always indicate success, as it is the status of the
  `local` declaration, not the command substitution.
- To work around a bug in some versions of Bash whereby arrays declared with
  `declare -g` or `export` and initialized in the same statement eventually go
  out of scope, always `export` the array name on one line and initialize it the
  next line. See:
