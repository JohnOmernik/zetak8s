## Due diligence

- [ ] I am familiar with the ["Reporting issues" section of CONTRIBUTING.md][reporting]
- [ ] I have searched the [existing issues][issues] and haven't found one that matches what I'm reporting or requesting now.
- [ ] If this is a bug report, I have searched the [Bash changelog][changes] for information that may explain or provide clues to the behavior I'm observing and reference it in the body of the report.

## Framework, Bash, and operating system version information

```
If this is a bug report, replace this preformatted section with the output from:

$ ./go goinfo

Otherwise remove this section altogether.
```

## Description

Replace this text with a description of your bug report or feature request.

If this is a bug report, include any relevant command line steps, code snippets, or test cases to reproduce the issue.
